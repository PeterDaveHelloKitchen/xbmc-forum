This folder contains all adjustments to the myBB forum done by TEAM XBMC. NO core file (unless bugfixes, see install.txt) is modified in any way and should not in future. Use available hooks to add features or try to inject a custom extended/modified class by using hooks, but don't alter them directly!


Please note that commits to the master branch will automatically be deployed on the live server - so only commit to master if your changes are tested. Use a development branch to test new features.
